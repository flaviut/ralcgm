                  RAL-CGM Interpreter Version 3.00
                  ================================

RAL-CGM is a program to Translate or Interpret CGM metafiles, either to a
different encoding (Binary, Character or Clear Text) or to view on a
terminal (using X-Windows, Silicon Graphics GL or Tektronix 4200 series)
or to send to a plotter (PostScript or HPGL). RAL-CGM has been tested on the
following machines: Sun 3 and 4, Silicon Graphics IRIS 3130 and Indigo,
DECstation 500, IBM RS6000, HP9000, VAX VMS, IBM VM/CMS and IBM PS/2.

This new release 3.00 adds the HPGL and Tektronix 4200 output to the
supported drivers. Both of these new drivers are incomplete but perform most
drawing functions. This release also adds configuration files for HPUX, ULTRIX
and RS6000 and fixes bugs in large Cell Array handling.

In RAL-CGM release 2.00 and before, the handling of negative integers was
wrong in Binary Encoded CGMs. This has now been corrected but means that
Binary CGMs produced from earlier versions of RAL-CGM may be incorrect.
As very few CGMs include negative integers, this will probably not cause a
problem, but if it does a new option (-gbin) has been introduced to read an
old CGM successfully.
